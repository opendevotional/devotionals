He could coax birds, beasts, and even the likeness of people out of gnarled roots and fallen branches. One summer, a wealthy merchant commissioned Hemlock to carve a life-sized wooden statue of an eagle for his garden. The merchant, a man used to getting his way, gave Hemlock very specific instructions: the wings must be spread exactly 45 degrees, the beak slightly open as if in a call, and the eyes fierce and commanding. Hemlock, who usually worked according to the spirit of the wood and his own artistic vision, felt constrained. He tried to explain that forcing the wood into such a precise form might weaken it, that the wood itself seemed to want to be something slightly different. But the merchant was adamant, holding fast to his vision. Hemlock, needing the commission to support his family, reluctantly agreed.\n\nAs Hemlock worked, he found himself growing increasingly frustrated. The wood resisted, splitting in places, and the eagle felt lifeless and forced. He felt a deep sense of unease, a nagging feeling that he was betraying not only his art but also a deeper principle. He remembered the words of his grandfather, a man of deep faith: 'Obedience to a lesser command that violates a greater one is disobedience indeed.' Hemlock realized that his obedience to the merchant's rigid demands was a form of disobedience to his own conscience, his artistic integrity, and, ultimately, to God, who had gifted him with his talent and the wisdom to understand the wood's nature.\n\nFinally, after days of wrestling with his conscience, Hemlock decided to speak to the merchant. He explained his concerns, admitting that he couldn't create the eagle as specified without compromising its integrity. He offered to return the advance payment, fully expecting the merchant's wrath. To his surprise, the merchant listened, and after a long silence, he relented. He told Hemlock to carve the eagle as he saw fit, trusting his artistic judgment. The resulting eagle, born of Hemlock's renewed artistic freedom and obedience to his conscience, was a masterpiece. Its wings flowed naturally, its beak suggested a gentle strength, and its eyes held a quiet wisdom. It was, in every way, a far greater creation than the merchant had initially envisioned. This story illustrates that true obedience often requires us to be willing to disobey lesser commands that conflict with higher moral or spiritual principles. We must listen to our conscience, discern God's will, and have the courage to follow it, even when it's difficult.", "image_description": "A close-up of a partially carved wooden eagle head with tools resting nearby on a workbench in a woodcarver's shop. ", "insights": "The conflict between Hemlock and the merchant highlights a crucial aspect of obedience: discerning which commands hold the highest authority. Scripture teaches that while obedience to earthly authorities is important (Romans 13:1-7), it must never supersede our obedience to God (Acts 5:29). Jesus Himself challenged rigid adherence to the law when it conflicted with compassion and justice (Matthew 12:1-8). True obedience requires wisdom, discernment, and a willingness to prioritize God's will above all else.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, grant me the wisdom to discern Your will in all situations. Help me to recognize when obedience to lesser commands conflicts with Your higher calling. Give me the courage to stand firm in my convictions, even when it's difficult or unpopular. Empower me to live a life of true obedience, guided by Your love and truth. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "Think about a time when you felt conflicted between obeying authority and following your conscience. How did you resolve the conflict?
