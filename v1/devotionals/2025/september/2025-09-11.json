{"date": "2025-09-11", "title": "The Overflow of Service", "sub_title": "Serving with a Joyful Heart", "devotional": "Eliza had always believed in acts of service, but lately, she'd been feeling like a short-order cook in a restaurant where every customer had a complicated, unending order. Her church's volunteer coordinator had called, desperately needing help with the upcoming community outreach event. Her neighbor's garden was overgrown, her sister needed help moving, and her aging parents needed more and more assistance. Eliza loved helping, truly, but the constant demands left her feeling drained and resentful. She confessed to a friend, \"I'm starting to feel like service is a bottomless pit! I give and give, and it's never enough.\"\n\nHer friend gently reminded her of the story of Jesus washing the disciples' feet. It wasn't just an act of servitude; it was an act of love, humility, and a model for leadership. It wasn't about depleting oneself to meet every need, but about discerning where God was calling her to serve, and doing it with a joyful heart.\n\nService, in its purest form, isn't about obligation; it's about overflow. It's the natural outpouring of a heart filled with God's love. It's recognizing the needs around us, but also recognizing our own limitations and seeking God's guidance on where we can best use our gifts and talents.\n\nTrue service requires discernment. We can't be all things to all people. Sometimes, the most loving thing we can do is to set boundaries and prioritize our own well-being, so we can serve from a place of strength and not resentment. It's about quality, not quantity. A single act of service, performed with love and intention, can be far more impactful than a dozen acts done out of obligation.\n\nSo, let us examine our hearts. Are we serving out of love or obligation? Are we seeking God's guidance or simply reacting to every demand? Let us strive to be servants who are filled with the joy of the Lord, serving with a willing heart and a clear sense of purpose, understanding that true service is an act of worship, a reflection of God's own selfless love for us.", "image_description": "A stone basin with clear water flowing over a smooth, worn dipper gourd.", "insights": "Jesus' act of washing the disciples' feet (John 13:1-17) is a powerful example of servant leadership. He, being their Lord and Teacher, humbled Himself to perform a task typically done by a servant. This demonstrates that true greatness lies in service and humility. Paul's words in Galatians 5:13 also resonate: 'You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.'", "prayer": "Lord, I confess that I often struggle with the demands of service. Help me to discern where You are calling me to serve and to do so with a joyful heart, not out of obligation. Give me the wisdom to set healthy boundaries and prioritize my own well-being, so I can serve from a place of strength and love. Fill me with Your Spirit, that my service may be a reflection of Your selfless love for others. Amen.", "reflection": "In what areas of your life do you feel overwhelmed by the demands of service?
