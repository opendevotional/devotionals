Every New Year's Eve, she'd meticulously plan out her resolutions, each one a carefully constructed promise to improve herself in some way. But this year felt different. The weight of past failures pressed heavily on her, making the prospect of another year of unmet goals feel daunting. As the clock ticked closer to midnight, she found herself sitting alone in her dimly lit living room, the celebratory sounds of the city muffled by the closed windows. Instead of excitement, a sense of quiet dread filled her. \n\nA memory flickered through her mind \u2013 a picture her grandmother had given her years ago. It wasn't a particularly beautiful image, just a simple drawing of a lighthouse standing firm against a raging storm. On the back, her grandmother had written, \"Courage isn't the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.\" That night, Eliza didn't write any resolutions. Instead, she prayed for courage \u2013 not to achieve impossible goals, but simply to face each day with a little more faith and a little less fear. She prayed for the strength to be present in the moment, to find joy in the small things, and to trust that even in the midst of the storm, God's light would guide her.\n\nAs the New Year dawns, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of resolutions and self-improvement plans. However, true transformation doesn\u2019t come from striving for perfection, but from embracing the courage to face our imperfections with grace and humility. Courage isn't about grand gestures or heroic feats; it's about the quiet strength to keep going, even when we feel like giving up. It's about choosing faith over fear, hope over despair, and love over judgment.\n\nSo, as you step into this new year, remember that courage isn't a destination, but a journey. It's a daily choice to trust in God's plan, even when you can't see the path ahead. Embrace the unknown with a spirit of adventure, knowing that God is with you every step of the way. And may this new year be filled with the courage to live fully, love deeply, and shine brightly, no matter what challenges may come your way.", "image_description": "A simple drawing of a lighthouse standing tall against a stormy sea, with a single beam of light cutting through the darkness, illuminating the crashing waves. The lighthouse is built of stone.", "insights": "The story of Eliza and the lighthouse drawing reflects the teachings of Joshua 1:9, where God encourages Joshua, 'Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.' This verse reminds us that courage isn't about our own strength, but about God's presence and power working within us. It aligns with the Apostle Paul's words in Philippians 4:13, 'I can do all things through him who strengthens me,' emphasizing that our courage is rooted in our relationship with Christ.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, as we stand on the threshold of a new year, I ask for Your courage to face whatever lies ahead. Help me to release my fear and embrace Your perfect plan for my life. Grant me the strength to keep going, even when I feel overwhelmed or discouraged. Fill me with Your love and light, that I may shine brightly for You in all that I do. Thank you for being with me always, guiding me, and giving me the courage to live fully and love deeply. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.", "reflection": "What fears or anxieties are you carrying into the new year? How can you actively cultivate courage in your daily life?
