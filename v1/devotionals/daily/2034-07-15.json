{"date": "2034-07-15", "title": "The Active Choice of Compassion", "sub_title": "Seeing God in Everyone", "devotional": "A young doctor named Elias worked tirelessly at the city hospital. He was known for his skill, but even more for his compassion. He would sit with patients who had no family, hold the hands of the fearful, and always had a kind word, even when he was exhausted. One sweltering July afternoon, a homeless man, Thomas, was brought in with a severe heatstroke. Many dismissed him, seeing only his disheveled appearance and the odor that clung to him. Elias, however, saw a human being in distress. He worked diligently, cooling Thomas down, administering fluids, and staying by his side long after his shift ended.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and Thomas slowly recovered. He had no insurance, no resources, and nowhere to go. The system seemed set up to forget him. Again, Elias showed compassion. He coordinated with social workers, found temporary housing, and even helped Thomas secure a simple job. Many questioned Elias\u2019s investment in someone who seemingly had nothing to offer in return. But Elias simply replied, 'We are all children of God. And in serving him, we must serve others.'\n\nElias understood that compassion isn't just a fleeting emotion; it's an active choice, a commitment to see the image of God in every person, regardless of their circumstances. Compassion means recognizing shared humanity and acting with love, even when it's inconvenient or uncomfortable. It goes beyond feeling sorry for someone; it compels us to step into their suffering and offer practical help. The summer heat can be oppressive, mirroring the heat of difficult situations people face. Like Elias, we\u2019re called to offer relief.", "image_description": "A gentle stream flowing through a lush green forest. Sunlight filters through the canopy, illuminating the water.", "insights": "The story of Elias reflects Jesus\u2019s parable of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10:25-37. The Samaritan, an outsider, showed compassion to a wounded traveler when others, including religious leaders, passed him by. Jesus asks, 'Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?' (Luke 10:36). The answer is clear: the one who showed mercy. Similarly, Matthew 25:40 states, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' These verses underscore that compassion is not optional for followers of Christ; it's a fundamental expression of our faith.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, open my eyes to see those around me who are hurting and in need. Give me a compassionate heart, like that of Jesus, that I may be moved to action. Help me to overcome my own self-centeredness and to reach out with love and practical help to those who are suffering. Guide me to be a vessel of Your mercy and grace in a world that so desperately needs it. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.", "reflection": "Who are the 'Thomases' in your life or community?
