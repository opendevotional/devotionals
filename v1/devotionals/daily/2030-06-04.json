A successful architect, she could envision structures before they existed, troubleshoot problems with ease, and navigate complex building codes. Yet, when her elderly mother, Margaret, began showing signs of dementia, Eliza felt utterly lost. The familiar strategies of logic and planning seemed useless against the unpredictable nature of the disease. She read books, consulted doctors, and joined support groups, gathering information like a frantic collector, but true understanding remained elusive.\n\nOne afternoon, while visiting Margaret, Eliza found her mother meticulously arranging a collection of smooth, colorful stones. Margaret wasn't building anything or following any discernible pattern; she was simply handling each stone with gentle reverence. Eliza, accustomed to projects with clear objectives, felt a surge of frustration. 'Mom, what are you doing?' she asked, her voice tinged with impatience.\n\nMargaret looked up, her eyes momentarily clear. 'Just enjoying the colors, dear. They remind me of God's creation. So many beautiful things.'\n\nIn that moment, Eliza realized she was approaching her mother's illness with the same analytical mindset she used in her profession, trying to solve a problem rather than simply being present with her mother in her present reality. Wisdom, she understood, wasn't just about acquiring knowledge; it was about understanding when to let go of the need to control and instead embrace the moment, finding beauty and meaning even in the face of loss and confusion.\n\nTrue wisdom, the kind that nourishes the soul, often comes not from frantic searching, but from quiet contemplation, from appreciating the simple gifts of each day, and from offering compassion without judgment. It is seeing the beauty in the stones, not just the potential building.", "image_description": "A collection of smooth, colorful river stones arranged on a wooden surface.", "insights": "Proverbs 4:7 states, 'Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.' This verse doesn't advocate for merely accumulating facts but rather for cultivating the ability to discern truth, beauty, and goodness in all circumstances. James 3:17 adds that 'the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere,' highlighting the character traits associated with genuine wisdom.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I confess that I often equate knowledge with wisdom, striving to understand everything rather than surrendering to Your guidance. Teach me to cultivate a spirit of humility and discernment, to find beauty and meaning in the present moment, and to offer compassion without judgment. Grant me the wisdom to navigate life's challenges with grace and peace, trusting in Your unwavering love and presence. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.", "reflection": "In what area of your life are you trying to solve a problem instead of embracing the present moment?
