A young college student, eager to share the gospel, approached him. \"Sir,\" the student began, \"do you know Jesus?\" Hemlock looked up, his eyes twinkling. \"Know Him? Son, I've been irritating Him for 70 years!\"\n\nThat humorous exchange highlights a truth about evangelism: it's not about a single encounter, but a relationship. It's about planting seeds, watering them, and trusting God for the harvest. February can feel like a long winter slog. The initial excitement of the new year has faded, and the warmth of spring seems distant. It's tempting to retreat inward, to focus on our own comfort. But this is precisely when the world needs the light of Christ.\n\nEvangelism isn't confined to street corners or organized events. It's woven into the fabric of our daily lives. It's the kindness we show to a weary coworker, the encouragement we offer a struggling friend, the integrity we demonstrate in our business dealings. It's living a life that reflects the love and grace of Jesus, so that others are drawn to Him.\n\nThink about the Apostle Paul. He didn't just preach in synagogues; he engaged with philosophers in Athens (Acts 17), debated in marketplaces, and wrote letters to churches scattered throughout the Roman Empire. He used every opportunity to share the good news, adapting his message to his audience while remaining true to the core message of the gospel.\n\nEvangelism is not a performance; it's an overflow. It's sharing the joy and peace that we've found in Christ, not out of obligation, but out of love. It's recognizing that every person we encounter is a potential brother or sister in Christ, and treating them with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n\nIn these late-winter days, let's be intentional about seeking opportunities to share the love of Christ. A simple act of kindness, a word of encouragement, a listening ear\u2014these can be powerful seeds that God uses to draw others to Himself. And remember, it's not about us convincing anyone; it's about being faithful to share, trusting that God will do the rest.", "image_description": "A snow-covered porch swing gently moving in a light breeze, with a steaming mug of coffee on the side table.", "insights": "The concept of evangelism as a relational process is supported by Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 3:6-7: 'I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.' This emphasizes that our role is to be faithful in sharing the gospel, while trusting God to work in the hearts of those we encounter.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of salvation and the joy of knowing You. Help me to be a faithful witness to Your love and grace. Give me eyes to see the opportunities You place before me each day, and the courage to speak Your truth in love. May my life be a reflection of Your character, drawing others to You. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "What are some practical ways you can share the love of Christ in your daily life?
