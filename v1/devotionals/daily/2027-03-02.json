The rhythmic scrape of his knife was the only sound louder than the chirping of the early spring birds. A young boy, Thomas, approached hesitantly. Thomas was worried. His family's farm, their livelihood, was in jeopardy. The well had run dry, and the spring rains were late.\n\n\"Mr. Hemlock,\" Thomas began, his voice barely a whisper, \"the well\u2026 it's gone dry. Papa says we don't know what we'll do.\"\n\nOld Man Hemlock didn't look up. \"The land provides,\" he said simply, continuing to shave curls of wood from the block. Thomas shuffled his feet, frustration building. How could the old man be so calm? Didn't he understand the severity of the situation?\n\nSeeing Thomas's distress, Hemlock finally paused. \"Thomas,\" he said, his voice raspy but kind, \"did I ever tell you about the great drought of '68?\" Thomas shook his head.\n\n\"Well, son, the whole county was parched. Creeks dried up. Crops withered. Folks were panicking. Your grandpa, a stubborn man he was, refused to give up hope. Every morning, he'd walk out to his fields, not to lament what was lost, but to tend to what remained. He trusted that even in the driest season, the land held a promise of renewal.\"\n\nHemlock continued, \"One morning, after weeks of unrelenting sun, a small patch of green appeared in the middle of his most barren field. A single sprout pushing its way through the cracked earth. It gave him the strength to keep going and to believe that rain would eventually come.\"\n\n\"Did it rain?\" Thomas asked, his eyes wide.\n\n\"It did,\" Hemlock said, a smile crinkling the corners of his eyes. \"Not immediately. But your grandpa's faith, his trust in the land, kept him going until the clouds finally broke. And you know what? It wasn't just rain that came. It was the biggest harvest he ever had.\"\n\nHe handed Thomas the piece of wood he'd been working on \u2013 a small, roughly carved bird. \"Sometimes, Thomas,\" he said, \"all we can do is tend to what remains and trust that the land \u2013 and the Lord \u2013 will provide.\"", "image_description": "A dry, cracked field with a single, vibrant green sprout emerging from the earth.", "insights": "Old Man Hemlock's story illustrates the profound importance of trust, especially when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Romans 5:3-5 tells us that 'suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God\u2019s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.' Thomas was experiencing a period of suffering and drought but just as Grandpa kept tending to the land, we must tend to our faith through prayer and trust. By being faithful and by actively doing what we can, we allow ourselves to believe that God will see us through.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, life often presents us with dry seasons, times when we feel parched and uncertain. Help us to remember that even in the midst of these challenges, You are with us. Grant us the strength to tend to what remains, to nurture our faith, and to trust in Your provision. Fill us with hope and remind us that just as rain eventually falls on a parched land, Your blessings will eventually flow into our lives. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "What \"dry season\" are you currently facing in your life? How can you \"tend to what remains\" and nurture your faith during this time?
