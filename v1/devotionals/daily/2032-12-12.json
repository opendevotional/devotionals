He wasn't reading. His Bible rested open on his lap, but his gaze was fixed on the skeletal branches of the oak tree in his front yard, dusted with the first frost of the season. He'd lived through ninety-two winters, seen the oak shed its leaves countless times, only to be reborn each spring. \n\nHis grandson, a bright-eyed college student named Ethan, emerged from the house, bundled in a thick scarf. \"Thinking about something, Grandpa?\" he asked, settling into the swing beside him.\n\n\"Just watching the oak,\" Hemlock replied, his voice raspy but warm. \"Reminds me of life, Ethan. Seasons come and go. Some years the storms are fierce, stripping us bare. Others are gentle, letting us bask in the sun. But the roots, boy, the roots\u2026 they're what matter.\"\n\nEthan frowned. \"Roots? You mean family? Values?\"\n\nHemlock chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. \"Those too, son. But I'm talking about wisdom. Knowing what's truly important, what lasts when the winds howl. Like that oak, we need strong roots of wisdom to weather the storms. It takes years to grow those roots. Years of learning, listening, and sometimes, getting knocked down and learning to get back up.\"\n\nHe tapped the Bible on his lap. \"This book, it's full of the water and sunlight those roots need. Proverbs, especially. Teaches you how to live a life that's not just long, but good. How to choose the right path, even when it's hard. How to be honest, kind, and fair. How to fear the Lord, which, believe it or not, is the beginning of it all.\"\n\nHemlock pointed to the bare branches. \"See those buds, Ethan? Tiny little things, holding the promise of spring? Wisdom is like that. It starts small, but it grows, year after year. And it's what allows us to bloom, even when the world around us is cold and barren. So read the Book, listen to the wise, and don't be afraid to learn from your mistakes. That's how you grow the roots that will hold you firm, no matter what the winter brings.\"", "image_description": "Bare, frost-covered branches of an old oak tree against a muted winter sky, no people or animals are in sight.", "insights": "Proverbs 4:7 states, \"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.\" This verse emphasizes that wisdom should be our highest pursuit. It's not merely knowledge, but the ability to apply that knowledge to live a righteous and fulfilling life. James 3:17 describes the characteristics of godly wisdom: \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.\"", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I thank you for the gift of wisdom. Help me to seek it diligently, to learn from your Word and from the experiences of life. Grant me the discernment to make wise choices, the courage to stand for what is right, and the humility to admit when I am wrong. May my life be a reflection of your wisdom, bringing glory to your name. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "What area of your life requires more wisdom right now?
