He wasn't lonely, not exactly. He was...unseeing. Not literally, his vision was surprisingly sharp for his age. But he was unseeing in the way one becomes blind to the beauty of the everyday. The vibrant colors of the late summer blooms in his garden had dulled to a monotonous green. The intricate patterns of sunlight filtering through the leaves of the ancient oak tree in his yard were just...light. He was going through the motions, a clockwork figure in a world bursting with life.\n\nOne sweltering afternoon, a small, bright yellow bird landed on the railing near Fitzwilliam. It was a warbler, flitting about, a tiny ball of energy. Fitzwilliam watched it idly, no real interest sparking within him. Then, the bird tilted its head, its beady black eyes fixed on Fitzwilliam. It chirped, a series of sharp, insistent notes. Fitzwilliam, surprised, found himself truly *looking* at the bird. He saw the delicate curve of its beak, the intricate feather patterns, the way its tiny chest puffed with each breath.\n\nThat small encounter was a crack in Fitzwilliam's wall of unseeing. He began to notice other things. The way the late afternoon sun cast long, golden shadows. The scent of honeysuckle carried on the breeze. The laughter of children playing down the street. He started paying attention, a subtle shift, yet monumental in its impact. \n\nIn our spiritual lives, we too can become 'unseeing'. We go through the motions of prayer, Bible reading, and church attendance, but our hearts aren't truly engaged. We lose our awareness of God's presence in the everyday miracles that surround us. We become so focused on our problems and our own internal narratives that we miss the beauty and the blessings that God offers us moment by moment. The cure? Pay attention. Intentionally cultivate awareness. Look for God in the small things, the unexpected moments. Reclaim the joy of truly *seeing* the world with eyes of faith.", "image_description": "A porch swing on a porch, looking out over a lush garden bathed in the golden light of late afternoon with various flowers and plants.", "insights": "The story of Fitzwilliam echoes the biblical call to be watchful and alert. In 1 Peter 5:8, we are cautioned to 'Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.' While Peter's warning focuses on spiritual warfare, it underscores the importance of awareness. Similarly, Jesus frequently urged his disciples to 'keep watch,' (Matthew 24:42, Mark 13:33) not just for his return, but for the opportunities to serve and to witness God's presence in their lives. Cultivating awareness is not a passive exercise; it requires active engagement and intentionality.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, forgive me for the times I've been spiritually unseeing, for the moments I've missed Your presence in the beauty and the challenges of my life. Help me to cultivate a spirit of awareness, to open my eyes to the small miracles and unexpected blessings that surround me. Help me to be watchful and alert, not just to the dangers of the world, but to the opportunities to serve and to witness Your love. Grant me the grace to truly see, to truly live, and to truly know You in all things. Amen.", "reflection": "Where in your life have you become spiritually unseeing?
