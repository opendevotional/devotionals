Every summer, she\u2019d visit the farmer\u2019s market, carefully selecting the plumpest, juiciest berries. Back in her kitchen, the air would fill with the sweet scent of simmering fruit, a symphony of warmth and anticipation. She always made enough to share, gifting jars to neighbors, friends, and even the grumpy Mr. Henderson down the street.\n\nOne year, a late frost damaged many of the local berry crops. Eliza arrived at the market to find tables sparsely filled, prices sky-high. Discouragement washed over her. Making jam felt less like a joyful tradition and more like an impossible feat. She could easily skip it, buy some store-bought preserves and call it a day. No one would know the difference, right?\n\nAs she was about to turn away, she saw Mrs. Gable, an elderly woman who always sat by herself at church, gazing sadly at the few remaining strawberries. Eliza remembered Mrs. Gable sharing how her late husband used to love strawberry jam on his morning toast. A warmth spread through Eliza, a feeling that had little to do with the summer heat. Despite the scarcity and expense, she knew what she had to do.\n\nShe carefully selected the best of the berries, even though it meant spending more than she intended. Back in her kitchen, the simmering fruit felt different this year. It wasn't just about the sweet scent; it was about the joy of giving, the love poured into each jar. She made a special batch just for Mrs. Gable, adding an extra touch of cinnamon, knowing it was her favorite.\n\nLove, like Eliza\u2019s jam-making, isn't always easy. It requires sacrifice, effort, and sometimes, giving even when it feels like there\u2019s not enough to go around. But when we act with love, even in small ways, we create something beautiful, something that nourishes not only others but also our own souls. In a world that often prioritizes self-interest, choosing love is a revolutionary act.", "image_description": "A close-up of homemade jam jars, filled with vibrant red berry jam and tied with twine, sitting on a wooden table in a sunlit kitchen.", "insights": "The act of selfless love is central to Christian teaching. 1 John 4:7-8 states, 'Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.' This passage emphasizes that love is not merely an emotion but a defining characteristic of God and a reflection of our relationship with Him. Furthermore, Galatians 5:13 reminds us, 'For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.'", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, thank you for the gift of love. Forgive me for the times I have been selfish or unwilling to extend love to others, especially when it's difficult or inconvenient. Help me to see opportunities to show love in my daily life, whether through small acts of kindness or more significant sacrifices. Fill my heart with your love, so that I may be a vessel of your grace and compassion to those around me. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "Think about a time when you experienced selfless love from someone else. How did it make you feel? What is one small act of love you can commit to today, even if it stretches you beyond your comfort zone? How can you prioritize love over self-interest in your daily interactions?", "topic": "Love", "reference": {"book": "1 John", "chapter": 4, "verse_start": 7, "verse_end": 8}}
