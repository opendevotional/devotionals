Each piece was a testament to patience, skill, and a deep understanding of the wood's nature. People marveled at his ability to transform ordinary logs into breathtaking works of art. One spring morning, a young apprentice named Elias approached Tiberius with a question that had been nagging at him. \"Master,\" Elias began, \"I see the beauty in your creations, but how do you know what to carve? How do you see the angel hidden within the wood before you even begin?\"\n\nTiberius smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. He picked up a rough, gnarled piece of oak. \"Elias,\" he said, \"the angel is already there. My task isn't to create the angel, but to reveal it. I remove the parts that are not the angel.\"\n\nThis simple statement contains a profound truth about wisdom. Wisdom isn't about acquiring vast amounts of knowledge, but about discerning what is true and essential, and then removing the obstacles that prevent it from shining forth. Like Tiberius, we must approach life with a willingness to patiently and carefully remove the unnecessary, the false, and the distracting, so that the inherent goodness and purpose within us and around us can be revealed.\n\nOften, our lives are cluttered with anxieties, fears, and misguided priorities. These are the things that obscure the path to wisdom. We chase after fleeting pleasures, accumulate possessions, and strive for worldly success, believing that these things will bring us fulfillment. But true wisdom lies not in what we gain, but in what we release.\n\nJust as Tiberius carefully examines the wood, seeking out the angel within, we must examine our own lives, identifying the areas where we are holding onto things that are not essential. Are we clinging to grudges that poison our hearts? Are we pursuing goals that are ultimately empty? Are we allowing fear to paralyze us from taking risks for God's kingdom?\n\nWisdom is the art of subtraction. It's the ability to discern what truly matters and to let go of everything else. It's the courage to remove the unnecessary, so that the essential can shine forth. Like Old Man Tiberius, may we seek the wisdom to reveal the beauty and purpose that God has already placed within us and in the world around us.", "image_description": "Close-up of a woodcarver's hands gently shaping a piece of wood with a chisel, shavings curling around the almost-finished form of an angel. Soft, natural light illuminates the scene.", "insights": "The story of Old Man Tiberius echoes the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 6:19-21, where He urges us not to store up treasures on earth, where moths and rust destroy, but to store up treasures in heaven, where our heart will also be. This emphasizes the importance of prioritizing eternal values over fleeting worldly possessions. Proverbs 4:7 states, 'Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding' (NIV), highlighting the immeasurable value of wisdom.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, grant me the wisdom to discern what is true and essential in my life. Help me to identify the things that are obscuring my path and preventing me from living fully in accordance with Your will. Give me the courage to release the unnecessary, the false, and the distracting, so that the beauty and purpose You have placed within me can shine forth. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "What 'excess baggage' are you carrying in your life that is hindering your spiritual growth?
