Change terrified her. Even the thought of trying a new coffee shop filled her with anxiety. She worked at the same accounting firm for 20 years, ate the same turkey sandwich every day for lunch, and vacationed at the same cabin in the Poconos every summer. Her life was predictable, safe, and\u2026 small. One day, a letter arrived. It was from her adventurous Aunt Clara, whom she hadn't seen in years. Clara was a missionary in the Amazon and was now too old to continue the work. She was asking Eliza to come and help her close down the mission and return to the States.\n\nThe thought of traveling to the Amazon jungle sent Eliza into a tailspin. Dangerous animals, unfamiliar languages, insects... Her meticulously constructed comfort zone was about to be obliterated. But as she reread Clara's heartfelt plea, something stirred within her. A flicker of something she hadn't felt in decades - a sense of purpose, a longing for something more than spreadsheets and turkey sandwiches.\n\nShe knew she had a choice. She could stay safe, hidden within her predictable routine, or she could step out in faith, embrace the unknown, and answer Clara's call. The decision gnawed at her, but as she prayed, a verse kept coming to mind: 'Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.' (Deuteronomy 31:6). It wasn't a guarantee of safety, but it was a promise of God's presence. With trembling hands, Eliza wrote back to Clara, 'I\u2019m coming.'\n\nThe journey was arduous, the conditions challenging, but as Eliza worked alongside her aunt, something began to shift within her. She discovered a resilience she never knew she possessed. She learned to rely on God's strength instead of her own. The fear was still there, but it was overshadowed by a growing sense of purpose and joy. Eliza learned that courage isn't the absence of fear, but the willingness to move forward in spite of it. She was still cautious, but she was no longer captive to her fear. She had found a new definition of courage - one that was rooted in faith, trust, and the unwavering presence of God.", "image_description": "A dense, green Amazonian rainforest with a small wooden path leading into the distance, symbolizing a journey into the unknown.", "insights": "Eliza's story mirrors the biblical call to courage. Joshua 1:9 says, 'Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.' This wasn't a suggestion; it was a command, and the basis for that command was the promise of God's constant presence. Similarly, David encourages Solomon in 1 Chronicles 22:13, saying, 'Be strong, and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you.' The consistent message throughout scripture is that courage isn't a self-generated feeling, but a response to the presence and promise of God.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I confess that I often allow fear to paralyze me. I long for safety and comfort, but I know that You call me to step out in faith, even when I'm afraid. Give me the courage to trust in Your presence and Your promises. Help me to remember that You are always with me, guiding me, and strengthening me. Grant me the strength to overcome my fears and embrace the opportunities You have placed before me. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "What are some areas in your life where you're currently feeling afraid? How can you apply the principles of faith, trust, and God's presence to overcome those fears? What is one small step you can take today to move beyond your comfort zone and embrace a new level of courage?", "topic": "Courage", "reference": {"book": "Deuteronomy", "chapter": 31, "verse_start": 6, "verse_end": 6}}
