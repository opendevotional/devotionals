They felt\u2026 undeserved. Like she was tricking people into thinking she was better than she truly was. So, she\u2019d deflect, downplay, or outright deny any positive remark thrown her way. If someone said, \"That's a lovely dress, Eliza!\", she'd reply, \"Oh, this old thing? I got it on sale years ago.\" or if a colleague said, \"You gave a great presentation today!\", she'd retort, \"I stumbled over my words twice! It was a disaster.\"\n\nHer friend, Samuel, noticed this pattern. One sunny afternoon, as they sat in a park, Samuel turned to Eliza and said, \"You know, you're remarkably talented at making beautiful pottery.\" Eliza, as expected, began to protest, citing all her mistakes and imperfections. But Samuel gently interrupted, \"Eliza, can you try something for me? Just this once, instead of deflecting, could you just say 'thank you'? Accept the compliment with grace.\" He explained that by constantly denying positive feedback, she wasn't just diminishing her own efforts but also subtly rejecting the giver's kindness. \n\nEliza, taken aback, considered his words. It wasn't just about her; it was about the graciousness of accepting a gift, even a verbal one. It was about honoring the intention behind the compliment, recognizing the good that others saw in her, and acknowledging the value of her own work, not with pride, but with humble acceptance. It was about allowing herself to be blessed by the affirmation of others. She decided to try it.\n\nThe next time someone complimented her, she hesitated, then took a deep breath and simply said, \"Thank you. I appreciate that.\" It felt awkward at first, but over time, it became easier, even empowering. She began to understand that accepting a compliment wasn't about arrogance; it was about graciousness, acknowledging the good in herself and the kindness of others. It opened her up to receiving blessings she had unknowingly been pushing away. This, she realized, was a small but significant act of grace, both to herself and to those around her. It was about seeing herself through a lens of compassion and understanding, recognizing her worth and contributions, and accepting the kindness and affirmation offered by others. The ability to accept kindness and compliments with grace is a reflection of how we understand and appreciate God\u2019s unearned favor in our lives.", "image_description": "A sunlit park bench, with a small, intricately carved wooden box resting on it, partially open, emitting a soft, warm glow.", "insights": "The Bible speaks extensively about grace, often defined as unmerited favor. However, a crucial aspect of grace is our willingness to receive it. Just as Eliza initially struggled to accept compliments, we may sometimes resist the blessings and kindness God offers, feeling unworthy or undeserving. Ephesians 2:8-9 states, 'For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.' This emphasizes that grace is a gift, freely given, and our role is to humbly accept it.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I confess that I often struggle to accept Your grace and the kindness of others. Help me to see myself as You see me \u2013 worthy of love and blessing. Teach me to receive compliments and gifts with graciousness, recognizing the good in myself and the kindness of those around me. Open my heart to Your unmerited favor and help me to live a life worthy of Your grace. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "In what ways do you struggle to accept compliments or acts of kindness?
