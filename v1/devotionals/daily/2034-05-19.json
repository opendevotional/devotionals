Each stone, worn smooth by the relentless current, represented something strong and enduring to her young mind. Years later, as a successful architect designing soaring skyscrapers, she remembered those stones. One day, tasked with designing a new chapel, Eliza felt a profound shift. It wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about creating a space that inspired awe and reverence. \n\nShe recalled visiting grand cathedrals in Europe, marveling at the intricate stained glass and soaring arches, but feeling disconnected. She wanted something different. Something that spoke to the human spirit on a more intimate level. She went back to the river. This time, the river was higher, the current stronger. She struggled to find a stone, almost slipping. But she kept trying. Finally, she found one, larger than the others. As she held it, she imagined people walking into her chapel. Not to be dwarfed by the grandeur, but to be drawn inward, to the heart of something holy.\n\nEliza designed the chapel with natural light, simple lines, and locally sourced stone. No stained glass, just the soft glow of the sun. No soaring arches, just a gentle curve of the ceiling, creating a sense of enclosure and peace. She added a small waterfall, mimicking the river. The space became a sanctuary, a place where people could connect with the divine in their own way, free from pretense. The key element became humility. \n\nTrue reverence isn't about the external display of piety; it's about an inward posture of humility and awe before the sacred. It's about recognizing our place in the grand scheme of things and approaching God with a spirit of openness and surrender. It is letting the building draw a person closer and feeling in tune with a higher presence.", "image_description": "Smooth, grey river stones piled on top of each other near a gently flowing river, soft sunlight illuminating the stones.", "insights": "Reverence, as exemplified in Psalm 89:7, speaks to the profound respect and awe we owe to God: 'God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be held in reverence by all who are around him' (ESV). The Bible emphasizes the importance of approaching God with a humble and contrite heart, recognizing His holiness and our own limitations. This contrasts with pride or arrogance, which can hinder our ability to truly connect with the divine. True reverence involves acknowledging God's sovereignty and submitting to His will.", "prayer": "Gracious God, help me cultivate a heart of reverence. Soften any pride that might keep me from truly seeing You. Remind me of Your holiness, and help me approach you with humility and awe. May my life reflect a deep respect for Your presence in every moment. I pray that reverence guides all that I do. Amen.", "reflection": "What does reverence mean to you in your daily life? How can you cultivate a greater sense of awe and respect for the sacred in your interactions, your work, and your relationship with God? How might you create a physical space that promotes a sense of reverence and connection with the divine?", "topic": "Reverence", "reference": {"book": "Psalm", "chapter": 89, "verse_start": 7, "verse_end": 7}}
