More than the taste, she loved the sharing of her creations. One sunny afternoon, she baked a triple batch of cookies: chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and peanut butter. As they cooled, she imagined the smiles they would bring. But as she was about to package them, a harsh storm rolled in. The lights flickered, then died, plunging her kitchen into darkness. The wind howled, and the rain beat against the windows.\n\nFearful, Eliza peered outside. Across the street, she saw Mrs. Gable, an elderly widow, struggling to secure her garden furniture. Knowing Mrs. Gable's frail health, Eliza felt a pang of compassion. Ignoring the storm raging outside, Eliza grabbed a raincoat and a plate of cookies and dashed across the street. Mrs. Gable, surprised but immensely grateful, welcomed Eliza inside. Over warm cookies and tea, Eliza listened to Mrs. Gable's stories and helped her feel less alone during the frightening storm.\n\nThat evening, as the storm subsided and Eliza returned home, she realized something profound. While she intended to spread joy through baking, the unexpected storm led her to a different, deeper kind of sharing \u2013 the sharing of compassion and presence. Sometimes, the interruptions and unexpected challenges in our lives present the greatest opportunities for showing compassion and love, just as Christ demonstrated.\n\nWhen we're interrupted by life, we should remember how Jesus would react to such occurrences. He would be kind, and offer help, just as Eliza did for her neighbor.", "image_description": "A covered plate of freshly baked cookies sitting on a windowsill as a storm rages outside.", "insights": "Eliza's act of compassion reflects the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 25:40, where He says, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' This verse highlights the direct connection between our acts of compassion toward others and our service to Christ. Additionally, Galatians 6:2 encourages us to 'Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ,' emphasizing the importance of sharing in the sufferings and hardships of those around us.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, thank you for the reminder that compassion isn't just a feeling, but an action. Help me to see the opportunities in my day to extend kindness and love to those in need, especially when unexpected interruptions occur. May I be a vessel of your grace, reflecting your heart of compassion to the world around me. Amen.", "reflection": "How do you typically react when your plans are interrupted?
