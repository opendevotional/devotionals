The rhythmic scrape of his knife was the only sound besides the cicadas humming in the late summer heat. His granddaughter, Lily, bounced a ball nearby, the sound echoing in the otherwise still air. Lily stopped bouncing her ball, approaching her grandfather. \"Grandpa, why do you keep whittling the same piece of wood? You've been working on that bear for days, and it still doesn't look finished.\" Hemlock chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"Well, Lily-bug, strength ain't built overnight. It's like this wood. You gotta keep shaping it, taking away what ain't needed, to reveal what it's meant to be.\" \n\nLily, ever inquisitive, tilted her head. \"But what if you get tired? What if the wood is too hard?\" Hemlock paused, stroking his beard. \"There'll be times you're weary. Life throws hard knots your way. Times when you think you can't carve another inch. But that's when you gotta remember where your strength comes from. It's not just in your own hands, Lily. It's in the One who gave you those hands.\" He pointed the knife towards the heavens. \"He's the oak that stands firm in the storm. He's the river that keeps flowing, even when the banks are dry. He's the strength that never fails.\" \n\nHemlock then shared about times in his own life where he felt weak but God's strength sustained him. He spoke of losing his wife, and the difficult years of farming with little help and many droughts. He emphasized that although the challenges were formidable, his trust in God provided him strength. Even now, in old age, God sustained him. Each day, Hemlock chose to rely on God's divine strength for carrying out his tasks.\n\nJust like Hemlock's whittling, our faith journey is a process of continuous shaping and refinement. We face challenges, temptations, and moments of doubt that test our resolve. But in those times, we must remember that we are not alone. God is always with us, offering His unwavering strength to help us overcome any obstacle. We must continually engage in activities that give us strength in God, such as meditating on scripture, prayer, worshipping, and fellowship with other believers.", "image_description": "A close-up view of a weathered hand carefully whittling a piece of wood into the shape of a bear; a completed wooden bear rests nearby on a table.", "insights": "The source of true strength lies not within ourselves, but in God. As Paul writes in Philippians 4:13, 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me' (NKJV). This verse is not a promise of effortless success, but a testament to the power of God working within us, enabling us to persevere through any trial. Similarly, Isaiah 40:31 reminds us that 'those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint' (NIV).", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I acknowledge my weakness and dependence on You. I thank You for being the source of my strength and for never leaving my side. Help me to remember that You are always with me, empowering me to overcome any challenge I face. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit, that I may live a life that honors You. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "What 'hard knots' are you facing in your life right now?
