Every day, rain or shine, he would be out there, tending to his roses, humming softly, and always, always, pausing for a long moment to read from a small, worn book. Few knew what was in the book, but they saw the serenity it brought to his face, the way his eyes seemed to drink in something unseen.\n\nOne sweltering August day, young Sarah, battling a profound sense of listlessness and purposelessness, found herself drawn to Mr. Abernathy's garden. She watched him clip a dead bloom, his movements deliberate and peaceful. Finally, unable to contain her curiosity, she approached him. \"Mr. Abernathy,\" she began, \"I hope you don't mind me asking, but what do you read every morning? It always looks like it brings you so much\u2026peace.\"\n\nHe smiled, a web of wrinkles crinkling around his eyes. \"Ah, Sarah,\" he said, holding out the small book. \"It's nothing fancy, just a collection of Psalms and Proverbs, passages that have resonated with me over the years. But it's not just the words themselves, child. It's the act of making time, of dedicating myself to something greater than the day's demands. It's about fostering a quiet space where devotion can bloom, just like these roses.\"\n\nSarah glanced at the vibrant blooms surrounding them. \"So, it's not about reading the perfect verse, or having some profound revelation?\" she asked.\n\nMr. Abernathy chuckled. \"No, no. It's about the commitment, the showing up, the offering of your time and attention. Devotion isn't a feeling; it's a practice. And like any good practice, it requires discipline and consistency. Some days, I barely comprehend what I'm reading. Other days, a single phrase will strike me like lightning. But every day, I'm here, tending to my garden, and tending to my soul.\"\n\nSarah, inspired by Mr. Abernathy's wisdom, resolved to cultivate her own garden of devotion. She realized that in the monotony of daily life, those small, consistent acts of connection with the Divine could blossom into something beautiful and life-sustaining, like the roses in Mr. Abernathy\u2019s garden.", "image_description": "A close-up of a weathered, leather-bound book resting on a garden bench, surrounded by blooming roses and a pair of pruning shears.", "insights": "Mr. Abernathy\u2019s approach illustrates a key principle: devotion isn\u2019t a spontaneous feeling but a cultivated practice. This aligns with the teachings in Romans 12:1, which encourages us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, which is our spiritual act of worship. This is not about grand gestures but about consistent, dedicated service. The daily discipline of spending time in prayer and study can transform our hearts and minds, making us more receptive to God's guidance and more attuned to His presence in our lives.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, help me to cultivate a garden of devotion in my own life. Give me the discipline to set aside time each day to connect with You, even when I don't feel like it. Teach me to find joy in the simple acts of prayer, study, and service. Open my heart to Your guidance, and help me to grow in my relationship with You. In Jesus\u2019 name, I pray. Amen.", "reflection": "What does devotion mean to you?
