Christmas lights twinkled, casting a warm glow on the faces of shoppers hurrying by with bags full of gifts. He felt a pang of loneliness. His family was scattered across the country, and he hadn\u2019t heard from them much lately. He missed the days when his house was filled with the sounds of laughter, wrapping paper crinkling, and the aroma of freshly baked cookies. \n\nSuddenly, a young boy, no older than seven, approached Hemlock. The boy\u2019s eyes were wide with wonder as he gazed at the Christmas tree towering in the center of the square. \u201cIt\u2019s so big!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cAnd sparkly!\u201d Hemlock smiled. \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it? What\u2019s your name, son?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Leo,\u201d the boy replied. \u201cMy mom is getting hot chocolate. She said I could look at the tree, but I can\u2019t leave this spot.\u201d Hemlock chuckled. \u201cWell, Leo, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. I\u2019m Hemlock.\u201d\n\nThey sat in comfortable silence for a few moments, both captivated by the Christmas tree. Then, Leo turned to Hemlock and asked, \u201cAre you waiting for someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose I am,\u201d Hemlock said, his voice tinged with melancholy. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for that feeling of community, you know? The one that seems to appear every December, then vanishes on December 26th.\u201d\n\nLeo tilted his head, considering this. \u201cMy grandma says community is like\u2026 like a big blanket,\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cIt keeps you warm when you\u2019re cold and covers you when you\u2019re scared. But you have to share it, or it won\u2019t work right.\u201d\n\nHemlock stared at the young boy, surprised by his wisdom. \u201cA big blanket, huh?\u201d he mused. \u201cI like that.\u201d Leo\u2019s mother returned with two cups of hot chocolate. She smiled at Hemlock. \u201cThank you for keeping him company,\u201d she said. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d\n\nAs they walked away, Hemlock watched them go, realizing Leo was right. Community isn't something that magically appears; it's something we create, something we share. It isn't limited to familial or holiday events. It's an active effort to connect with those around us, offering warmth, support, and a sense of belonging. Maybe that lonely bench was an opportunity to connect after all.", "image_description": "A snow-covered park bench facing a large, brightly lit Christmas tree in a town square.", "insights": "Leo\u2019s simple explanation of community as a \u201cbig blanket\u201d resonates with the biblical understanding of fellowship. Hebrews 10:24-25 encourages us to \u201cspur one another on toward love and good deeds\u2026 encouraging one another.\u201d This highlights the active role we play in building community. It's not a passive experience but an intentional act of offering support, encouragement, and love to those around us. The passage emphasizes the importance of gathering together and investing in each other. Likewise, Paul often reminds the churches he is writing to that they are a body, and each part is as important as the others. Community comes about when everyone embraces this notion.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, forgive me for the times I've isolated myself and longed for connection without actively seeking it. Open my eyes to the opportunities around me to build community, to offer warmth and support to those who need it. Help me to be a part of the \u201cbig blanket\u201d that comforts and connects us all. Show me how to love and serve those around me, and enable me to see my purpose with them. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "How can you actively participate in building community this week? Is there someone you could reach out to, offer support to, or simply connect with? Consider those who may be feeling lonely or isolated.
