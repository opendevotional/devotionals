{"date": "2028-01-28", "title": "Unexpected Justice", "sub_title": "The Quiet Work of Restoration", "devotional": "Old Man Hemlock, they called him. Not to his face, of course. He lived alone on the outskirts of town, his small shack a testament to years of quiet solitude. The rumour mill churned stories: he'd cheated a business partner, swindled his neighbors, hoarded wealth while others starved during the lean years. The children were warned to avoid his property. Justice, they whispered, would eventually find him. But justice, it seemed, was taking its time.\n\nOne particularly harsh winter, the town's small supply of coal dwindled. Prices skyrocketed, and families shivered in their homes. Then, unexpectedly, anonymous bags of coal began appearing on doorsteps. No one saw who delivered them, but the whispers started again, this time with a different tone. A few brave souls noticed wagon tracks leading from Old Man Hemlock's property, and then returning empty.\n\nWas it possible? Could the man they'd deemed a villain be performing acts of quiet charity? The truth, of course, was far more complex than the rumors. Hemlock, years ago, *had* made a bad business decision that inadvertently harmed a partner. The guilt had gnawed at him ever since. He\u2019d spent years living frugally, saving a portion of his small income, waiting for an opportunity to right the wrong. When the coal crisis hit, he saw his chance. Anonymity was his shield against praise, and the town\u2019s lack of knowledge was an advantage so that he could give without receiving. His actions weren't about seeking redemption, but about embodying the justice he felt he\u2019d denied others.\n\nJustice isn't always the grand, sweeping pronouncements we expect. Often, it's the quiet, persistent work of individuals seeking to restore balance, to heal wounds, and to offer compassion where it's least expected. God calls us to be agents of this kind of justice, not to pass judgment or perpetuate cycles of resentment, but to actively seek reconciliation and restoration. It's about understanding that everyone, even the seemingly irredeemable, is deserving of grace and the chance to make amends.", "image_description": "A snow-covered, weathered shack with a faint light glowing from within.", "insights": "The story of Old Man Hemlock echoes Micah 6:8, which calls us to 'act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.' True justice, as demonstrated by Hemlock's actions, goes beyond simple retribution and seeks to alleviate suffering and restore broken relationships. This aligns with Jesus' teachings on forgiveness and compassion, urging us to extend grace even to those who have wronged us (Matthew 5:44). It reminds us that God's justice is restorative, not merely punitive.", "prayer": "Lord, open my eyes to the injustices around me, both large and small. Give me the courage to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with You. Help me to see others as You see them, with compassion and understanding. Show me how I can be an agent of restoration in a world that is often broken and divided. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.", "reflection": "Reflect on a time when you witnessed or experienced injustice. How did it make you feel? What actions can you take, however small, to promote justice and reconciliation in your own community? Consider someone you might have judged harshly. Can you find a way to extend grace or understanding?", "topic": "Justice", "reference": {"book": "Micah", "chapter": 6, "verse_start": 8, "verse_end": 8}}
