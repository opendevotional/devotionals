Its steeple, though weathered, still pointed resolutely towards the heavens. Inside, dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that streamed through the stained-glass windows, illuminating scenes from scripture. One morning, a young man named Ethan, a self-proclaimed skeptic, wandered into the church. He wasn't searching for faith, but rather, historical information for a school project. He planned to quickly photograph the interior and leave.\n\nAs he walked down the aisle, however, he couldn't shake off a strange feeling. It wasn\u2019t a booming voice or a miraculous sign, but rather a deep, quiet sense of something significant, something ancient and powerful that permeated the very stones of the building. He found himself stopping before the altar, his eyes drawn to the simple wooden cross. He thought of the many who had knelt there before him, seeking solace, forgiveness, or guidance. He imagined their prayers, their hopes, their fears, echoing through the years.\n\nEthan realized he had come into a place set apart. While at first the building seemed like an ancient relic, He now realized that it was a place where people poured their souls to God and it was a place where God met those people. It wasn't about the architecture or the history, but about the reverence it inspired. A deep respect for something larger than himself washed over him, a humility he hadn't felt before. The project suddenly seemed insignificant compared to the profound sense of the sacred that filled the church.\n\nThis feeling, this sense of the sacred, is what reverence truly is. It\u2019s an awe-filled recognition of the divine, a humbling awareness of God\u2019s presence and power. It\u2019s not merely a feeling of respect, but a deep, heartfelt acknowledgment of His holiness and majesty. As the season of Lent draws to a close, consider how you cultivate reverence in your life. Do you approach God with a humble and contrite heart? Do you recognize the sacredness of His presence in your everyday moments? Are there places or activities where you sense His nearness more acutely? Embrace the opportunity to cultivate a spirit of reverence, allowing it to shape your thoughts, words, and actions.", "image_description": "Sunlight streams through stained-glass windows in an empty, old church, illuminating the wooden altar and cross.", "insights": "Reverence is a key theme in scripture, reflecting the appropriate response to God's holiness. Psalm 89:7 states, 'God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him' (KJV). Leviticus 19:30 commands, 'Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD'. Jesus himself demonstrated reverence in the Garden of Gethsemane, praying with deep humility and submission to the Father's will (Luke 22:42).", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, forgive me for the times I have approached You with a casual or irreverent spirit. Help me to cultivate a deeper sense of reverence for Your holiness and majesty. Open my eyes to recognize Your presence in every aspect of my life, and grant me the humility to approach You with a contrite and grateful heart. May my thoughts, words, and actions reflect my deep respect and love for You. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "Where do you most easily encounter a sense of the sacred in your life?
