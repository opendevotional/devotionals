She'd often make batches of cookies or loaves of bread, not for herself, but to share with her neighbors, the local shelter, or even just a stranger she felt needed a little brightening of their day. She called it \"Baking for Jesus,\" and it was her way of spreading a little light in a sometimes-dark world. One blustery March day, Eliza felt prompted to bake for a young couple who had just moved in down the street. She hadn't met them yet, but something told her they could use a little encouragement. She baked a warm apple pie, its cinnamon scent filling her kitchen with a cozy aroma. As she walked down the street, pie in hand, she prayed for the opportunity to share more than just a dessert with them.\n\nWhen she knocked on their door, a young man answered, his face etched with weariness. He and his wife, Sarah, had been struggling to find work after moving to the area and were feeling quite disheartened. Eliza, with her warm smile and apple pie, was a welcome sight. After sharing the pie, she gently inquired about how they were settling in. As they talked, Eliza shared her faith, not in a preachy way, but by simply explaining how her relationship with Jesus gave her strength and purpose, even when things were tough. She offered to help them search for job openings and invited them to a local church service. They politely accepted, more out of gratitude for her kindness than any deep spiritual longing, or so Eliza thought.\n\nA few weeks later, Eliza was surprised to see Sarah at the church service. After the service, Sarah approached her, tears in her eyes. She confessed that Eliza's simple act of kindness and genuine faith had deeply touched her and her husband. They had been searching for something more in their lives, and Eliza's baking and words of faith sparked a newfound interest in exploring Christianity. It wasn\u2019t the apple pie that had the power, it was the love of Jesus that shone through it, compelling her to share her love for Jesus and for people. Eliza realized that even the simplest acts of kindness, done in the name of Jesus, can be powerful tools for evangelism.", "image_description": "A warm apple pie sitting on a wooden countertop next to a bouquet of daffodils.", "insights": "Eliza's story demonstrates that evangelism isn't just about preaching sermons or handing out tracts. It's about living out our faith in tangible ways, showing love and kindness to others, and being open to sharing our personal experiences with Christ. As it says in 1 Peter 3:15, 'But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect.' It's about being prepared to share the reason for our hope, but doing so with gentleness and respect, just as Eliza did with the young couple.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, thank you for the countless ways you demonstrate your love and grace. Give me a heart that is willing to share that love with others, not through forceful or judgmental words, but through simple acts of kindness and a genuine expression of faith. Help me to be a light in the world, reflecting your love and drawing others closer to you. Guide my actions so that my life may be a testament to your goodness and grace. I pray for opportunities to share my story, my hope, and my love with those you place in my path. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "How can you \"bake for Jesus\" in your own life?
