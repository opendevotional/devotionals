She felt a deep sense of purpose in serving others, a calling she attributed to her unwavering faith. Yet, as the years passed, Eliza began to feel weary. The endless demands, the constant giving, and the seemingly bottomless needs of those around her started to take their toll. Doubts crept into her mind: Was she truly making a difference? Was her service actually helping, or just a temporary fix to a much larger problem? Had she become so focused on *doing* for others that she'd forgotten the *why* behind her service?\n\nOne blustery December afternoon, Eliza found herself sitting alone in her cozy apartment, staring out the window at the swirling snow. The holidays were fast approaching, and the pressure to do more, give more, and be more weighed heavily on her shoulders. She felt depleted, like a well that had run dry. \"Lord,\" she whispered, \"I'm tired. I don't know if I can keep doing this.\" In that moment of vulnerability, a memory surfaced \u2013 a conversation she'd had with her grandmother years ago. Her grandmother, a woman known for her quiet acts of service, had once told her, \"Service isn't just about what you *do*, Eliza. It's about *who you are* while you're doing it. Are you serving with love, with joy, with humility? Or are you serving out of obligation, out of guilt, out of a need for validation?\" Her grandmother\u2019s gentle question hung in the air, a piercing light illuminating the true essence of service.\n\nEliza realized that she had, indeed, become more focused on the *doing* than the *being*. She had allowed the demands of service to overshadow the joy and love that should be at its heart. She needed to reconnect with the source of her strength, to remember that true service flows from a place of deep connection with God, a place of gratitude, and a genuine desire to share His love with others. That evening, Eliza decided to simplify her holiday commitments. She chose to focus on a few key areas where she felt truly passionate and connected, rather than trying to do everything for everyone. She spent time in prayer, asking God to renew her strength and to fill her with His love. As she did, a sense of peace washed over her, a reminder that true service is not about burning out, but about shining brightly with the light of Christ.", "image_description": "A snow-covered window with a single lit candle on the windowsill.", "insights": "The story of Eliza resonates with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of serving with a humble and compassionate heart. In Matthew 20:28, Jesus says, '...the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.' This verse highlights the self-sacrificing nature of true service, but it also underscores the importance of serving with the right motivation \u2013 out of love and a desire to emulate Christ. 1 Peter 4:10-11 further emphasizes that we should use our gifts to serve one another, 'as good stewards of God\u2019s varied grace,' doing so with the strength that God provides, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I thank you for the opportunity to serve others. Forgive me for the times when I've allowed the demands of service to overshadow the joy and love that should be at its heart. Fill me with your Spirit, that I may serve with humility, compassion, and genuine love. Renew my strength and help me to remember that true service flows from a place of deep connection with you. Guide me to the areas where I can make the greatest impact, and help me to shine brightly with your light. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "In what areas of your life do you feel called to serve? Are you serving with the right motivation \u2013 out of love and compassion, or out of obligation or guilt? How can you simplify your commitments and focus on serving in ways that bring you joy and allow you to shine with the light of Christ?", "topic": "Service", "reference": {"book": "Matthew", "chapter": 20, "verse_start": 28, "verse_end": 28}}
