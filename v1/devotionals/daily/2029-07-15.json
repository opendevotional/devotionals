Children would tiptoe past his house, whispering stories of his sharp tongue and even sharper shears, which he supposedly used to keep neighborhood cats away from his precious blooms. One sweltering summer afternoon, Sarah, a young girl known for her boundless curiosity and equally boundless compassion, noticed Mr. Abernathy struggling to water his roses. His hands trembled, and his face was flushed. Ignoring the whispers and her own apprehension, Sarah approached him.\n\n\"Mr. Abernathy,\" she called out timidly. \"Can I help you with that? It looks heavy.\"\n\nHe scowled at first, his usual reaction to any interaction. But something in Sarah\u2019s genuine offer, her lack of fear, seemed to soften him. He grunted and reluctantly handed her the hose. For the next hour, Sarah carefully watered each rose bush, her small hands navigating the prickly stems with surprising dexterity. Mr. Abernathy watched, his scowl slowly fading into a look of quiet contemplation. When they were finished, he simply nodded, a gesture that felt like a monumental thank you.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Sarah continued to help Mr. Abernathy with his garden. She learned the names of each rose variety, the importance of pruning, and the secrets to keeping the aphids away. More importantly, she learned that beneath Mr. Abernathy\u2019s grumpy exterior lay a lonely and vulnerable heart. His wife had passed away years ago, and the roses were his way of keeping her memory alive. Sarah\u2019s simple act of compassion had not only eased his burden but had also blossomed into a beautiful friendship.\n\nSarah reminds us that compassion sees beyond the surface. It's about recognizing the shared humanity in everyone, even those who seem unapproachable or unkind. It's about extending a hand, offering a kind word, or simply being present for someone in need, without expecting anything in return. It means seeing others the way God sees them, with love and understanding. It is a year round calling. The summer heat reminds us that even the grumpiest or the most lonely may need care.", "image_description": "A close-up shot of a vibrant, red rose in full bloom, with droplets of water glistening on its petals.", "insights": "The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) exemplifies the essence of compassion. The Samaritan, unlike the priest and the Levite, chose to help a stranger in need, demonstrating selfless love and empathy. Similarly, in Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus emphasizes the importance of caring for the 'least of these' - the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, and the prisoner - stating that whatever we do for them, we do for Him.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, open my eyes to see the needs of those around me. Help me to extend compassion to everyone I encounter, especially those who seem difficult or unlovable. Grant me the courage to reach out, offer a helping hand, and share Your love with the world. Remind me that even small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.", "reflection": "Who in your life could use a dose of compassion?
