She volunteered at the local soup kitchen, donated to charity, and treated everyone with kindness. Yet, despite her best efforts, a gnawing sense of inadequacy persisted. She felt like she was constantly falling short of some unseen standard, like a student perpetually cramming for a test she could never quite pass.\n\nOne day, while reading the story of the prodigal son, Eliza had an epiphany. The son had squandered his inheritance, wallowed in sin, and returned home expecting nothing but scorn. Yet, his father welcomed him with open arms, celebrating his return with a lavish feast. It wasn't the son's perfect behavior that earned him his father's love; it was his willingness to acknowledge his shortcomings and return home.\n\nEliza realized that righteousness wasn't about achieving moral perfection, a feat impossible for any human being. It was about acknowledging our imperfections, seeking forgiveness, and striving to live in accordance with God's will. It was about surrendering our self-righteousness and embracing the grace offered through Jesus Christ.\n\nTrue righteousness isn't earned through good deeds alone, it's a gift, freely given to those who believe. Like the prodigal son, we don't deserve it, but God's love and mercy extend far beyond our merit. It's a transformation that begins within, a shift in perspective that allows us to see ourselves and others through the lens of grace.\n\nWe are not called to be perfect, but to be perfected. This journey of sanctification is a lifelong process, marked by stumbles and triumphs, doubts and unwavering faith. But through it all, God's grace remains our constant companion, guiding us towards a righteousness that is not our own, but His.", "image_description": "An open Bible with a soft light shining on the pages, with a focus on the words 'grace' and 'mercy'.", "insights": "The concept of righteousness is often misunderstood. Romans 3:22 states, 'This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.' This emphasizes that righteousness is not attained through works but received through faith. Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, 'God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.' This highlights the sacrificial nature of Christ's righteousness being imputed to believers.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I confess that I often strive for righteousness in my own strength, falling short and feeling discouraged. Thank you for the gift of grace, freely given through Jesus Christ. Help me to surrender my self-righteousness and embrace the righteousness that comes from you. Guide me on the path of sanctification, and fill me with your love and mercy. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "In what areas of your life are you striving for righteousness on your own?
