{"date": "2033-11-08", "title": "Keep Planting", "sub_title": "The Tenacity of Old Man Hemlock", "devotional": "Old Man Hemlock was known throughout the valley for his tenacity. Not because he was a successful farmer \u2013 quite the opposite. Every year, a new blight, a late frost, or overly aggressive squirrels would decimate his crops. Neighbors offered advice, newfangled techniques, even genetically modified seeds. He politely refused, always planting the same heirloom variety of corn his grandfather had, in the same stubbornly inefficient way. He just shrugged and said, \"The good Lord provides what He provides. My job is to keep planting.\"\n\nMost secretly thought him a fool. Why persist in failure? Yet, year after year, Old Man Hemlock was out there, tilling the soil, sowing the seeds, watering the parched earth, even when it seemed hopeless. Then one year, a devastating swarm of locusts swept through the valley, devouring every field in sight. Except one. For some reason, they bypassed Old Man Hemlock's meager patch. While everyone else faced starvation, he had enough to share, enough to get them through the winter.\n\nPerseverance isn\u2019t about achieving immediate success; it\u2019s about faithfulness in the face of adversity. It\u2019s about trusting that God is at work, even when we can\u2019t see the harvest. It\u2019s about continuing to sow seeds of faith, hope, and love, even when the soil seems barren. It\u2019s about knowing that our efforts, though small, are not insignificant in God's grand design. He uses our faithfulness in the mundane to bring about extraordinary results. When everything around us screams to quit, to give up, to take the easy way out, perseverance whispers, \"Keep planting.\"", "image_description": "A weathered, calloused hand sowing seeds in rich, dark soil under an overcast sky.", "insights": "The Bible is replete with examples of perseverance. Noah spent years building the ark, despite ridicule and disbelief. Abraham waited decades for the promised son, Isaac. Moses led the Israelites through the wilderness for forty years, facing constant rebellion. Hebrews 12:1-2 encourages us to 'run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.' It's through imitating their steadfastness and focusing on Jesus that we can find the strength to endure.", "prayer": "Lord, forgive me for the times I\u2019ve given up too easily, when I\u2019ve allowed discouragement to overwhelm me. Grant me the strength to persevere in the face of adversity, to trust in Your plan even when I can\u2019t see the path ahead. Help me to be faithful in the small things, knowing that You use them to bring about great things. Remind me that my efforts are not in vain and that You are always with me, guiding and sustaining me. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.", "reflection": "Where in your life are you tempted to give up? What seeds of faith, hope, or love do you need to keep planting? How can you better fix your eyes on Jesus and draw strength from His example of perseverance?", "topic": "Perseverance", "reference": {"book": "Hebrews", "chapter": 12, "verse_start": 1, "verse_end": 2}}
