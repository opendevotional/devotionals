He used to say, \"Eliza, a blessing isn't always a windfall of gold. Sometimes it's the strength to weather the storm, the wisdom to see the lesson, or the love that binds us together.\" She hadn\u2019t understood it then, not fully. Now, years later, struggling to keep her small business afloat amidst a wave of economic downturn, his words echoed in her heart.\n\nShe\u2019d prayed for a miracle, for a sudden influx of customers. Instead, the requests trickled to nearly nothing. Discouraged, she considered giving up. But then, she remembered her grandfather\u2019s stories \u2013 tales of resilience, of finding blessings in the ordinary, of using hardship as a chisel to sculpt character. He had been through so much yet was filled with kindness.\n\nOne afternoon, staring at the nearly empty shop, a young boy wandered in, his eyes wide with wonder at the carvings. He admired a small wooden sheep, its woolly texture lovingly detailed. Eliza, instead of immediately trying to sell it, began to tell him the story behind it - how her grandfather used to raise sheep and that the carving reminded him of him. The boy listened intently, a quiet solace in his gaze. The boy explained he was buying it for his ill grandmother. Eliza gifted it to the boy, just asked him to remember her grandfather.\n\nThe next day, the boy and his grandmother visited Eliza. Touched by Eliza's kindness and the beauty of her work, the grandmother posted about the shop on her social media page. Within days, the shop was bustling with customers, not just buying carvings, but seeking a touch of Eliza\u2019s spirit, a piece of her kindness.\n\nEliza realized that the blessing wasn\u2019t the absence of hardship, but the presence of grace \u2013 the grace to offer kindness when she felt like giving up, the grace to see opportunity where others saw only loss, and the grace to remember her grandfather's words that true blessings often come disguised. The hardship was the ground out of which her truest blessing grew.", "image_description": "A close-up view of a intricately carved wooden sheep sitting on a workbench with wood shavings around it, a warm glow emanating from the scene.", "insights": "Eliza's story mirrors the biblical concept of blessings as more than just material wealth. Deuteronomy 28 outlines blessings for obedience, but the New Testament expands the understanding. Romans 5:3-5 speaks of rejoicing in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God\u2019s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. Thus, the true blessing may reside in the spiritual growth fostered by trials.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, open my eyes to see the blessings You place before me, even when they are disguised as challenges. Give me the strength to offer kindness, the wisdom to find opportunity, and the grace to grow through hardship. Remind me that Your love is constant, even in the darkest of times. Help me to trust in Your plan, knowing that You work all things for good. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.", "reflection": "What hardships are you currently facing?
