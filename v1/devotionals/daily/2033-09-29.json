The crisp September air, the golden hue of the rising sun, and the quiet hum of her small town were all music to her soul. But what Eliza cherished most was her time with God. Every morning, before the world woke up, she would sit on her porch swing with her Bible and a cup of steaming tea, pouring out her heart to the Lord and listening for His still, small voice.\n\nOne particular morning, however, Eliza felt\u2026distant. The words on the page seemed flat, the prayers felt forced, and the familiar sense of God's presence was nowhere to be found. Doubt crept in. Was she doing something wrong? Had she somehow displeased God? The thought weighed heavily on her heart.\n\nJust then, a small hummingbird zipped past, hovering near the vibrant petunias hanging from her porch. Eliza watched, mesmerized, as the tiny creature diligently extracted nectar from each flower. It occurred to her that the hummingbird wasn't soaring grandly, singing loudly, or putting on a show. It was simply and consistently performing its purpose, quietly fulfilling its role in the ecosystem.\n\nEliza realized that devotion wasn't always about grand gestures or emotional highs. It was about consistently showing up, day after day, even when she didn't feel like it. It was about the quiet, unwavering commitment to seeking God's presence, even when the path seemed dark and her heart felt empty. It was about recognizing that even the smallest acts of faithfulness were pleasing to God.\n\nFrom that day on, Eliza approached her morning devotion with a renewed perspective. She understood that it wasn't about the intensity of her feelings or the eloquence of her prayers, but about the steadfastness of her commitment. She continued to show up on her porch swing, Bible in hand, ready to connect with her Creator, not out of obligation, but out of love and a deep desire to know Him more.", "image_description": "A close-up of a hummingbird sipping nectar from a brightly colored petunia flower.", "insights": "The act of devotion, as illustrated in Eliza's story, emphasizes the importance of consistency over fleeting emotional highs. Hebrews 10:25 encourages us not to neglect meeting together, as is the habit of some, but to encourage one another. This verse underscores the value of regular, intentional acts of devotion as a means of strengthening our faith and fostering a deeper connection with God.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, forgive me for the times when I've allowed my emotions to dictate my devotion to You. Help me to understand that true devotion is not about grand gestures or fleeting feelings, but about a steadfast commitment to seeking Your presence, day after day. Grant me the strength to show up, even when I don't feel like it, and to trust that You are always with me, even in the quiet moments. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "In what ways can you cultivate a more consistent practice of devotion in your life?
