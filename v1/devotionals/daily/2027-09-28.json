Each one was a marvel of tiny gears and cleverly placed levers, all hand-carved from the fallen branches in his woods. But Hemlock had a problem. He was a perfectionist. Each toy had to be flawless before he\u2019d let it go. He\u2019d tinker and adjust, sand and polish, sometimes for months, always finding some minute imperfection that needed fixing.\n\nOne autumn, he started building a small carousel. He spent weeks carving the tiny horses, each with a unique expression. He designed a complex mechanism that would make them gallop up and down as the carousel spun. But when he finally assembled it, one of the horses bobbed slightly off-kilter. Hemlock was devastated. He spent days trying to fix it, but nothing seemed to work. Frustration mounted. He wanted it perfect. One blustery day, unable to bear the imperfection any longer, he threw the half-finished carousel into the woodpile, declaring it a failure. \n\nLater that evening, a little girl named Lily wandered by Hemlock\u2019s workshop. She spotted the carousel in the woodpile and, with Hemlock's permission, pulled it out. She didn\u2019t see the slightly off-kilter horse. All she saw was a beautiful, magical toy. She wound the crank, and the carousel sprung to life, the horses bobbing and dancing. Lily laughed with delight. Hemlock watched, a lump forming in his throat. He realized that his pursuit of perfection had blinded him to the joy his imperfect creation could bring. Lily enjoyed it more than he ever could imagine making it. \n\nHow often do we do this with our lives? We cling to control, striving for an ideal, a perfect version of ourselves, our circumstances, or our service to God, that may never exist. We hold back, fearing failure, imperfections, and vulnerability. We believe we must be perfect before God can use us. But God doesn't require perfection; He asks for surrender. He desires our willingness to offer our imperfect selves, our flawed efforts, to Him, trusting that He can use them for His glory. This is especially appropriate with the change in seasons. As summer fades to autumn, so too can our striving turn to rest as we surrender to God's timing. Surrender is not defeat, it is a victory of faith. Surrender enables us to find the joy in offering what we can.", "image_description": "A half-finished wooden carousel sits amongst logs in a woodpile, bathed in soft autumn sunlight filtering through the trees.", "insights": "The story of Old Man Hemlock illustrates the dangers of perfectionism and the beauty of surrender. Proverbs 3:5-6 advises, 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.' This verse highlights the importance of surrendering our desire for control and trusting in God's guidance, even when we don't understand His plans.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I confess that I often struggle with the need to control and perfect everything in my life. Help me to release my grip on these things and surrender to Your will. I offer You my imperfections, my fears, and my vulnerabilities, trusting that You can use them for Your glory. Teach me to find joy in serving You with what I have, knowing that Your grace is sufficient. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "What areas of your life are you struggling to surrender to God?
