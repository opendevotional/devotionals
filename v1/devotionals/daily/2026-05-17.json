{"date": "2026-05-17", "title": "The Heart of a Steward", "sub_title": "Caring for What's Been Entrusted to Us", "devotional": "Old Mr. Abernathy was known throughout the small town for his magnificent garden. Every spring, it burst forth in a riot of color, a vibrant testament to his careful cultivation. People would stop and stare, marveling at the perfectly pruned rose bushes, the bountiful vegetable patches, and the meticulously manicured lawn. Yet, Mr. Abernathy never hoarded the fruits (and vegetables!) of his labor. He generously shared his harvest with neighbors, donated flowers to the local church, and even taught gardening classes at the community center.\n\nOne day, a newcomer to town asked Mr. Abernathy the secret to his success. The old man smiled and said, \"It's not about what I own, but how I care for what's been entrusted to me. This garden isn't just mine; it's a gift I've been given to nurture and share.\" He explained that he saw his garden as a sacred responsibility, a way to honor God and bless others.\n\nThis idea of stewardship goes beyond merely managing possessions. It encompasses our time, talents, resources, and even our planet. God calls us to be responsible caretakers of everything He has created, using them wisely and generously for His glory and the benefit of others. We are not owners, but stewards, entrusted with managing these gifts according to God's will.\n\nIn our consumeristic society, it's easy to fall into the trap of accumulating more and more possessions, often driven by a desire for status or security. But true fulfillment comes not from hoarding, but from using what we have to make a positive impact on the world around us. This might mean volunteering our time, donating to worthy causes, or simply being more mindful of our consumption habits. It's about recognizing that everything we have is ultimately a gift from God and using it to reflect His love and compassion.\n\nSo, as we enjoy the beauty and abundance of this spring season, let us reflect on our role as stewards. How can we better care for the resources God has given us? How can we use our time, talents, and possessions to bless others and make a difference in the world? Let us cultivate a spirit of generosity and responsibility, recognizing that true wealth lies not in what we own, but in how we serve.", "image_description": "A lush, vibrant garden with a stone path winding through it, filled with colorful flowers, vegetables, and healthy plants.", "insights": "The concept of stewardship is deeply rooted in Scripture. Genesis 1:28 instructs humankind to 'have dominion' over creation, which is not a license to exploit, but a call to responsible caretaking. 1 Peter 4:10 encourages us to use our gifts to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace. Jesus' parables, such as the Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30), emphasize the importance of using our resources wisely and productively.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, thank You for the abundance You have blessed me with. Forgive me for the times I have been selfish or irresponsible with the resources You have entrusted to me. Help me to see myself as a steward of Your gifts, and guide me to use them wisely and generously for Your glory and the benefit of others. Teach me to cultivate a spirit of gratitude and responsibility in all areas of my life. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "What are some of the resources God has entrusted to you?
