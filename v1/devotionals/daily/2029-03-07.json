Every spring, as soon as the first green shoots bravely poked through the still-chilly earth, she\u2019d practically vibrate with anticipation. It wasn't just their bright, trumpet-shaped blooms; it was the sheer, audacious *joy* they seemed to exude. They were a defiant splash of sunshine against the lingering gray of winter, a promise that warmth and life would always return. \n\nOne year, a late frost threatened to ruin her daffodil display. Eliza woke one morning to a blanket of white covering her beloved flowers, their stems bent low under the weight of the ice. Her heart sank. She\u2019d been so looking forward to their cheerful faces greeting her each day. Disappointment threatened to overwhelm her. \n\nBut then, she remembered a passage from Philippians: \"Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!\" (Philippians 4:4). It seemed almost absurd to *rejoice* when her daffodils were covered in frost, but the verse wasn't conditional. It didn\u2019t say, \"Rejoice when everything is going your way.\u201d It simply commanded, \"Rejoice always.\" \n\nSo, Eliza did something unexpected. She bundled up, went outside, and carefully brushed the snow from the bent stems of her daffodils. As she worked, she began to pray, thanking God for the beauty that still remained, for the promise of spring, and for the simple joy of being alive. To her surprise, a feeling of peace washed over her. She couldn't control the weather, but she *could* control her response to it.\n\nThe next day, the sun shone brightly, melting the frost and ice. The daffodils, though a little battered, stood tall once more, their yellow trumpets blaring a joyful song. Eliza realized that true joy wasn't dependent on perfect circumstances, but on a steadfast trust in God's goodness, even when the world seemed bleak.", "image_description": "A close-up view of vibrant yellow daffodils, some with droplets of water on their petals, against a soft-focus green background.", "insights": "Philippians 4:4 is often quoted, but its context is crucial. Paul writes these words from prison, a situation hardly conducive to joy. Yet, he emphasizes that joy isn't based on external circumstances, but on an internal relationship with the Lord. This echoes Jesus\u2019 words in John 15:11, \u201cI have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.\u201d The source of true joy is God himself, not the absence of difficulties.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I confess that I often let my circumstances dictate my joy. Forgive me for focusing on what\u2019s wrong instead of on Your goodness. Help me to cultivate a spirit of rejoicing, even in the midst of challenges. Remind me that true joy comes from You, and that You are always with me, no matter what. Fill me with Your peace and help me to radiate Your joy to others. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.", "reflection": "What \u201cfrosts\u201d are you facing in your life right now?
