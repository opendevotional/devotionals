Not just the digital kind on her phone, but the worn, crinkled paper maps that smelled faintly of adventure. She\u2019d spend hours tracing routes with her finger, imagining the journeys they represented. One autumn, she decided to take a solo hiking trip in the Appalachian Mountains. She carefully studied her map, marked her intended path, and set off with enthusiasm.\n\nThe first few days were glorious \u2013 vibrant foliage, crisp air, and stunning vistas. But on the fourth day, a thick fog rolled in. The familiar trail markers vanished into the mist, and Eliza quickly realized she was lost. Panic began to set in. She pulled out her map, but it was useless in the limited visibility. The terrain all looked the same \u2013 endless trees shrouded in gray.\n\nJust as despair threatened to overwhelm her, she remembered something her grandfather, a seasoned hiker, had told her: 'When you're lost, stay put. Find a landmark, and wait for the fog to lift or help to arrive.' Eliza found a large, distinctive boulder and settled down to wait. She prayed, asking for guidance and strength. Hours passed, the fog remained thick, and doubt gnawed at her. Was she foolish to simply wait? Should she try to find her way back?\n\nThen, she recalled Psalm 46:10: 'Be still, and know that I am God.' Eliza closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and focused on trusting God\u2019s promise. She realized that being still wasn\u2019t passive, but an active choice to surrender her anxieties and trust in a higher power. As evening approached, she heard the distant sound of voices. She shouted, and soon, a search party found her. Safe and sound, she learned a valuable lesson: sometimes, the best way to find your way is to simply trust and wait for guidance.\n\nLife, like Eliza\u2019s hike, often presents us with foggy situations where the path ahead is unclear. During these times we must resist our urge to desperately forge ahead blindly, and instead patiently wait for divine guidance. We might never know exactly when the answer will present itself, but with faith in the lord, we can trust that all of our decisions will be righteous.", "image_description": "A winding hiking trail disappearing into a dense fog in a forest, with colorful autumn leaves scattered on the ground.", "insights": "Eliza's situation mirrors the Israelites' journey in the wilderness. God guided them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (Exodus 13:21). This demonstrates God's commitment to leading His people, even when the path is obscured. The key is to remain attentive to His guidance and trust in His timing, even if the destination isn\u2019t immediately visible.", "prayer": "Heavenly Father, thank you for your promise to guide me. When I feel lost and confused, remind me to be still and know that you are God. Help me to trust in your timing and to listen for your voice, even in the midst of the fog. Give me the patience and strength to wait for your direction. In Jesus' name, Amen.", "reflection": "Think about a time when you felt lost or uncertain. How did you seek guidance?
